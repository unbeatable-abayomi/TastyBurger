The Rules of the Grid:

Columns must be the immediate child of a Row. 
Rows are only used to contain Columns, nothing else. (DON’T PUT CONTENT DIRECTLY INSIDE THE ROW! Columns, and only columns, are placed inside the Row.)
Rows should be placed inside a Container.

Those rules are very IMPORTANT. The Rows & Columns always work together, and you should never have one without the other.

Bad stuff will happen if you don’t follow those 3 simple Grid rules, exactly. 

Responsive Breakpoints, based on screen width:

(xs) — screen width < 576px (This is the “default” tier)
sm — screen width ≥ 576px
md — screen width ≥ 768px
lg— screen width ≥ 992px
xl — screen width ≥ 1200px

Larger breakpoints, override Smaller breakpoints.
xs(default) >
overridden by sm >
overridden by md >
overridden by lg >
overridden by xl
